# Simple Calculator (two-input)
This repo is just my attempt at implementing a basic calculator with variables (in Java). Its function is relatively simple, following  basic arithmetic tasks like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, and variable assignment/usage. The attached repository contains the code file(s) needed to run this. 

** Note that this is not a software program, merely just a program that can be run via terminal or through an ide.

# Running the Program
To run this, you first got to download main file in the src folder. Afterwards, make sure you have Java installed on your machine to run this via terminal or on an ide with/without JDK versions. When in the terminal, you create the executable class for this program via 'javac calc.java' After which you can just call 'java calc' to run the program.

## Sample run
### Down below is a sample run of this program on a Windows machine. 
```
Choose operator +, -, *, /
+
Enter numbers to be calculated
10 10
20 
```
```
Choose operator +, -, *, /
*
Enter numbers to be calculated
20 200
4000
```

# Bugs
With the current status, program has no bugs that need addressing.

# Update 12/4/2024
** Although this program was originally supposed to support variables/assignment as well as parentheses operations, I wasn't able to finish it with these features due to external contraints.
Regardless, the calculator works fine with the four basic arithmetic operators (add., sub., mult., div.).
