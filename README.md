# About
This repo is just my attempt at implementing a calculator with variables (in Java). Its function is relatively simple, following  basic arithmetic tasks like addition, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, parentheses, and variable assignment/usage. The attached repository contains the code file(s) needed to run this. 

Note that this is not a software program, merely just a program that can be run via terminal or through an ide.
